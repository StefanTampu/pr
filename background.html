                    <h2>Almost three years have passed since we first met, my love. I did not image then that we would end up together, nor for so many years - and for how many more! You have become an essential part of my life, and it is hard for me to imagine a time without you. And yet we've had to deal with complications from the very beginning, all of which we've overcome. From this I have learned a few things:</h2>
                    <h2>Firstly, I've seen that, no matter how tought the situation, no matter my own faults (or yours), you've stuck by my side. I was shocked by your persistence and by your refusal to let rational consideration obstruct love. You have given yourself to me, unconditionally, and from this I have learned what it is to be loved.</h2>
                    <h2>Conversly, I have also learned what it is to love. At times I've had to make difficult decisions and sacrifices for you. I can't say that they've been totally happy decisions, but I've learned that there is a higher consideration: that which is meaningful and worthwhile, namely nurturing our bonds, growing in my affection for you, and seeing you blossom through my affection. I should not limit myself to overcoming difficulties, though. More commonly, our lives and plans together are a pleasure, and I wish to continue in this pleasure.</h2>
